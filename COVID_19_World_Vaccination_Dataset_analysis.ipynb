There exist many NaN values,so we forward-filled those and set to 0 those that cannot be filled. Although this process produces a believable dataset without missing values, it may produce some overestimation in some occasions. Another solution is to set all those values to 0, which may produse an underestimation. \n","\n","We will validate the results that we take with other official sources and assess the impact that our intervention has in the results from out desired task. The final preprocessing of the dataset will be decided at a later point, also accounting for the extra information that will be added from different
